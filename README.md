## Description

This application is designed to help researchers and epidemiologists explore and compare the efficiency of different clinical trial designs. Users can adjust a range of antibody-based and infection-based parameters—such as mosquito biting rates, antibody dynamics, and intervention effectiveness—to simulate trial outcomes and estimate required sample sizes.

The tool provides a dynamic interface to visualize the impact of these parameters on key metrics, allowing for a more informed decision-making process when planning costly and complex clinical trials.
